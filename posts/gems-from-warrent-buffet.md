- > “Over the years, a number of very smart people have learned the hard way that a long string of impressive numbers multiplied by a single zero always equals zero.”
- > “Price and value can differ; price is what you give, value is what you get.”

- > “Forecasts’, said Sam Goldwyn, ‘are dangerous, particularly those about the future.”
  > “speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.”

- > “Investors should pay more for a business that is lodged in the hands of a manager with demonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands of a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer.” -1984 letter”

- > “Our job is merely to identify talented managers and provide an environment in which they can do their stuff.” -1990 letter”

- > “Our goal is more modest: we simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”

- > “The five people who work here with me ... outproduce corporate groups many times their number. A compact organization lets all of us spend our time managing the business rather than managing each other.” -1982 letter

- > “Investors should be skeptical of history-based models. Constructed by a nerdy-sounding priesthood using esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the , these models tend to look impressive. Too often, though, investors forget to examine the assumptions behind the symbols. Our advice: Beware of geeks bearing formulas.”

- > “You can be highly successful as an investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to value a business. That’s what investing is all about.”

- > “Ben Graham taught me 45 years ago that in investing it is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results. In later life, I have been surprised to find that this statement holds true in business management as well. What a manager must do is handle the basics well and not get diverted.”

- > “It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked.” -1992 letter”

- > “Government has been exceptionally able in printing money and creating promises, but is unable to print gold or create oil.”

- > “So far, most politicians in both parties have followed Charlie Brown’s advice: ‘No problem is so big that it can’t be run away from.”

- > “No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: you can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.”

- > “The most important thing to do when you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.”

- > “It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked.”

- > “It pays to be active, interested and open-minded, but it does not pay to be in a hurry.”

- > “The banking business is no favorite of ours. When assets are twenty times equity - a common ratio in this industry - mistakes that involve only a small portion of assets can destroy a major portion of equity. And mistakes have been the rule rather than the exception at many major banks. Most have resulted from a managerial failing that we described last year when discussing the ‘institutional imperative:’ the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of their peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so. In their lending, many bankers played follow-the-leader with lemming- zeal; now they are experiencing a lemming- fate.”

- > “what the wise do in the beginning, fools do in the end.”

- > “on a pro forma basis: I have firm plans to "restructure" my putting stroke and therefore only count”

- > “In 1994, Coca-Cola sold about 280 billion 8-ounce servings and earned a little less than a penny on each. But pennies add up.”

- > “As one investor said in 2009 (regarding the effects of the Financial Crisis): ‘This is worse than divorce. I’ve lost half my net worth – and I still have my wife.’ ” -2010 letter”

- > “We purchased several companies whose earnings will almost certainly decline this year from peaks they reached in 1999 or 2000. The declines make no difference to us, given that we expect all of our businesses to now and then have ups and downs. (Only in the sales presentations of investment banks do earnings move forever upward.)” -2000 letter”

- > “It's a good idea to review past mistakes before committing new ones. So let's take a quick look at the last 25 years.” -1989 letter”

- > “No matter how attractive the prospects of their business. We've never succeeded in making a good deal with a bad person.” -1989 letter”

- > “the CEO who misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in private.” -1983 letter”

- > “Over the years, Charlie and I have observed many accounting-based frauds of staggering size. Few of the perpetrators have been punished; many have not even been censured. It has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen than small sums with a gun.” -1988 letter”

- > “An iron law of business is that growth eventually dampens exceptional economics.”
